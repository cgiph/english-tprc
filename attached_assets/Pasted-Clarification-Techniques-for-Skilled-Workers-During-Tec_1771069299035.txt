Clarification Techniques for Skilled Workers During Technical Assessments
Based on Australian workplace communication standards and employability skills frameworks, the following clarification techniques are considered appropriate, respectful, and professionally expected.

1. Paraphrasing (Restating in Your Own Words)
This is the safest and most recommended strategy.
You show understanding and check accuracy without asking the assessor to repeat.
Examples:

“So just to confirm, you’d like me to align the conduit before securing it, correct?”
“If I understand correctly, you want me to describe the lockout procedure for this machine?”

SkillsYouNeed notes that clarification often involves summarising the speaker’s message and checking accuracy. [skillsyouneed.com]

2. Asking Open Clarifying Questions
Use what, when, where, how, why questions—not “pardon?”
This shows active thinking and avoids giving the impression that you weren’t listening.
Examples:

“What torque level should be applied for this step?”
“Which specification should I refer to for this measurement?”

SkillsYouNeed emphasises that the best clarification questions start with open-ended prompts to deepen understanding. [skillsyouneed.com]

3. Seeking Specific Details (Challenging Ambiguity)
Useful when instructions include vague words like “properly,” “secure,” “aligned,” “healthy,” “everyone,” etc.
Examples:

“When you say ‘proper alignment’, do you mean within ±2 mm?”
“Which part of the unit are you referring to when you say ‘this section’?”

Women & Leadership Australia highlights the need to resolve ambiguous or “blinking” words by asking for specifics. [wla.edu.au]

4. Confirming Missing Details (Fixing Deletions)
When an assessor gives incomplete information, it’s appropriate to ask for the missing piece.
Examples:

“You mentioned this step is important—should it be completed before or after re‑pressurising the system?”

WLA lists “deletions” as common communication issues and recommends requesting missing details. [wla.edu.au]

5. Checking Assumptions (Avoiding Misinterpretation)
Before acting on an assumption, confirm.
Examples:

“Just confirming—should I proceed as if this system is energised, or are we treating it as isolated?”

WLA’s guidance on “distortions” stresses verifying assumptions before acting. [wla.edu.au]

6. Active Listening Signals
Non-verbal and verbal cues help show engagement and reduce the risk of perceived disrespect.
Examples:

“Okay, I see… so the next step is…”
Nodding, eye contact, note-taking.

Clarification is part of active listening, which SkillsYouNeed identifies as central to ensuring correct understanding. [skillsyouneed.com]

7. Summarising Before Acting
Before starting a task, summarise the instructions to ensure understanding.
Example:

“To make sure I’m following all steps correctly: first isolate the supply, then verify zero energy, and only then remove the cover—right?”
