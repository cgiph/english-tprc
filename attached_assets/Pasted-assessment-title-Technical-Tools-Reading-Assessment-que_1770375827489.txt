    {

      question: "Which of the following precision measurement tools is specifically designed to measure the gap width between two mechanical parts?",

      options: ["Vernier Caliper", "Micrometer", "Feeler Gauge", "Torque Wrench"],

      correctAnswer: "Feeler Gauge",

      rationale: "A Feeler Gauge consists of thin metal blades of varying thicknesses used specifically to measure clearance."

    },

    {

      question: "In a technical manual, 'Prior to igniting the torch, ensure the regulator pressure does not exceed 15 psi' means:",

      options: ["Pressure must be exactly 15 psi", "Pressure must be 15 psi or lower", "Pressure should be higher than 15 psi", "Check pressure after ignition"],

      correctAnswer: "Pressure must be 15 psi or lower",

      rationale: "'Does not exceed' sets a maximum limit, and 'Prior' means before the action."

    {

      question: "Which piece of PPE protects a welder from 'flash burn'?",

      options: ["Respirator", "Insulated Gloves", "Auto-darkening Helmet", "Steel-toed Boots"],

      correctAnswer: "Auto-darkening Helmet",

      rationale: "This helmet specifically filters harmful UV/Infrared light that causes flash burn."

    },

    {

      question: "Which word indicates a 'sequencing' step in a manual?",

      options: ["Subsequently", "Approximately", "Simultaneously", "Durable"],

      correctAnswer: "Subsequently",

      rationale: "'Subsequently' indicates an action that follows another in a specific order."

    },

    {

      question: "What is 'Tacking' in a mechanical/welding context?",

      options: ["A permanent finish", "Measuring thickness", "Small, temporary welds", "Grinding surface rust"],

      correctAnswer: "Small, temporary welds",

      rationale: "Tack welds are used to hold alignment before the final weld is performed."
