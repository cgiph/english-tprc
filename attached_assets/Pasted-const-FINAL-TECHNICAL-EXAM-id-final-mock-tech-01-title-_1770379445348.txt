      question: "You are reading a maintenance log: 'The spindle must be lubricated BI-WEEKLY.' How often should you perform this task?",
      options: ["Twice a week", "Every two weeks", "Twice a month", "Both B and C"],
      correctAnswer: "Both B and C",
      rationale: "In technical English, 'bi-weekly' can mean twice a week or every two weeks, but in maintenance logs, it usually refers to every two weeks (semi-monthly)."

      id: "q2",
      question: "Identify the correct sequence for equipment shutdown based on safety protocols:",
      options: [
        "Clean tools, Isolate power, Disconnect air",
        "Isolate power, Ensure stationary, Disconnect air",
        "Disconnect air, Clean area, Isolate power",
        "Inform supervisor, Leave station, Shut down"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "Isolate power, Ensure stationary, Disconnect air",
      rationale: "Safety sequences always prioritize 'Isolating' the power source first and ensuring moving parts have stopped before disconnecting secondary lines."

      question: "Which measurement is most critical when checking for 'Tolerance' in a precision engine part?",
      options: ["Weight", "Color", "Dimensions (using Micrometer)", "Surface Temperature"],
      correctAnswer: "Dimensions (using Micrometer)",
      rationale: "Tolerance refers to the allowable limit of variation in a physical dimension."

      question: "During a noisy briefing, you hear: '...DO NOT... valve... red...' What is the most likely instruction?",
      options: ["Open the red valve immediately", "The red valve is for water", "Do not turn the red valve", "The red valve needs painting"],
      correctAnswer: "Do not turn the red valve",
      rationale: "In 'Selective Listening,' the negative command (DO NOT) combined with the object (valve) and color (red) indicates a prohibited action."

      id: "q5",
      question: "What does the term 'Beveling' refer to in a welding preparation context?",
      options: ["Polishing the final weld", "Angling the edge of a plate", "Cooling the metal in water", "Measuring the gas flow"],
      correctAnswer: "Angling the edge of a plate",
      rationale: "Beveling is the process of shaping the edge of the material to allow for better weld penetration."
